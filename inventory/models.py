    @Description: The Product model represents a product with various properties.
    A product has a name, description, category, unit price, reorder level,
    and the timestamp it was created at as characteristics.
    @Fields:
        - product_name: This field is used to store the name of the product. Since it’s a CharField, it's used for shorter strings. The max_length=255 indicates the maximum length of the character field, meaning that the product name can't be longer than 255 characters. This field must be filled since NULL values are not allowed for it.
        - description: The description field is used for holding more detailed information about the product. Unlike product_name, this field can hold a substantial amount of text as it's a TextField. blank=True, null=True allows this field to be blank or NULL, meaning that it is not mandatory to provide a description.
        - category: This field is used to specify the category to which the product belongs. Like product_name, it’s a CharField and can't exceed 255 characters. But with blank=True, null=True, this field can be left blank during product creation/update if the category is not known or relevant.
        - unit_price: This field represents the base price of a single unit of the product. It's a DecimalField, which means it can store a very precise number and is excellent for storing an exact price. The max_digits=10 parameter indicates that no more than 10 digits may be used to represent the number, and decimal_places=2 specifies that 2 of those digits are reserved for representing decimal places.
        - reorder_level: The reorder_level field can be used in inventory management, for instance, to kick off a restocking process. If the amount of product falls below the reorder_level, it might be a good idea to reorder the product. default=0 means that if a reorder level is not specified when a product is created, it defaults to 0.
        - created_at:  This field is used for record-keeping purposes, so you know when each product was created. By default, when a product instance is created, it gets given a created_at value of the current date and time.
